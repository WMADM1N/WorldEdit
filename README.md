# 🏗️ WorldEdit

A Terraria plugin including many mass tile editing features. Documentation on commands is included in the [wiki](https://github.com/Terraria-Builders-Community/WorldEdit/wiki).

## ⚠️ Important:

WorldEdit source code has been privated. For the reasoning behind this feel free to private message me.

The source code is not privated due to not willing to share WorldEdit's internals. If you are a developer and you:
 
- Are interested in improving WorldEdit,
- Want to review the source code for legitimacy,
- Want to have access to recent developments & give feedback/reviews,

You can open an issue and I will grant access to the private repository. 

> Please note that you may not receive access if I suspect you want it for other reasons. I am free to deny your request for any reason I deem valid, as I am in control of my own work. Make sure to elaborate why you want access.

## 🆕 Releases:

Any work done on the private repository will be released here. WorldEdit is MIT licensed, so you are free to use the product anywhere you want.

## 🛑 Bugs & Issues:

- If you have access to the private repository and want to report bugs of unstable releases, please do it there. 
- If you are a regular WorldEdit user and/or want to report issues on the stable releases (which are released here), please do it here.
